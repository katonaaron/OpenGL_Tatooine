\chapter{Conclusions and further developments}

This application was a great opportunity to put together the concepts learned at the laboratories. Moreover it provided challenges which required mathematical and programming skills.

\textbf{The application can be further developed by:}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Adding spotlights and more point lights
 \item Animating R2-D2
 \item Creating logic for controlling the ship, including the collision detection
 \item Extending the scene with more detailed models
\end{itemize}
