\section{Functionalities} 

A passive functionality is the \textbf{baby yoda animation} (Figure \ref{fig:baby_yoda}), which shows him moving a rock by using the force. The rock is translated and rotated periodically.

The other funtionalities are enumerated in the following list:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Rotate the sun} in both directions. If the sun is beyond the horizont, the night scene is showed, otherwise the day scene. This action also changes the light direction.
 
 \item \textbf{Scale the sun}. Only the object is changed. It produces no lighting effect.
 
 \item \textbf{Increase/decrease the fog (sandstorm) density}.
 
 \item \textbf{Move and rotate camera} with keyboard and mouse.
 
 \item \textbf{Activate/deactivate camera animation}. The animation leads the viewer along a predefined path and ignores the keyboard and mouse movement inputs.
 
 \item \textbf{View the depth map} from the point of view of the sun.
 
 \item \textbf{Switch between viewing modes:} wireframe, solid with polygonal surfaces, solid with smooth surfaces 
 
 
\item \textbf{Activate/deactivate collision detection} 
\end{itemize}
