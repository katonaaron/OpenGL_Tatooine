\section{Data structures} 

The \verb|BoundingBox| data structure holds the minimum and maximum values of an object in two vectors: one for the lowest coordinates, one for the highest coordinates.

Additional data structures were created for storing the data which will be sent to the shaders. These are the same as the ones defined in the shaders. The enclosing modules implement methods for transmitting the structure to the shader. These types of data structures are:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item DirLight
 \item PointLight
 \item Fog
\end{enumerate}
